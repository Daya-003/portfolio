                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>The minor project titled “Expense Tracking Using OCR and Machine Learning” focused on building 
                    an intelligent system that could automatically extract and categorize expenses from uploaded receipts
                    or invoices using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and basic ML techniques.
                    The aim was to eliminate manual data entry and simplify financial record-keeping for individuals and 
                    small businesses.The core functionality was to allow users to upload an image or scanned copy of a receipt, 
                    from which the system would identify and extract key details like the merchant name, date, items purchased,
                    and total amount. This data would then be stored and categorized into predefined expense buckets such as food,
                    travel, utilities, etc.We used Python as the primary programming language. For OCR, we leveraged Tesseract OCR,
                     which efficiently extracted text from image files. Preprocessing tasks like noise reduction and image binarization
                      were performed using OpenCV to improve OCR accuracy. A basic Machine Learning model was trained using Scikit-learn
                       to classify the type of expense based on keywords and contextual features. Data was stored and managed using 
                       SQLite.One of the main challenges was dealing with varying image quality and inconsistent receipt formats.
                    To address this, we implemented adaptive image preprocessing techniques and tested multiple OCR configurations.
                     Another challenge was accurately categorizing expenses, especially when receipts contained non-standard terminology 
                     or abbreviations. This was tackled by enhancing the training dataset and refining the feature selection logic.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p>
                    Our major project focused on developing an AI-powered system for virtual furniture placement 
                    and interior decor recommendations, blending computer vision, 3D modeling, and 
                    AI to create immersive interior design experiences.The goal was to allow users to upload room images
                    or layouts and receive intelligent, real-time suggestions for placing furniture and decor items without
                    collisions or design inconsistencies.The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated 
                    with a Django backend for managing users, uploads, and processing requests. The AI logic was developed 
                    and tested using Python on Google Colab, utilizing libraries like OpenCV for room scanning, YOLOv8 
                    for object detection, and MediaPipe for depth estimation. For 3D modeling and visualization,
                    we explored Three.js and basic AR frameworks.The biggest challenge was achieving collision-free furniture 
                    placement and ensuring accurate object detection within diverse room layouts. We overcame this by training 
                    custom YOLO models and implementing a basic constraint satisfaction system to suggest only feasible placements. 
                    Another hurdle was ensuring cross-platform performance and low latency, which we handled by optimizing image size.
                    The outcome was a functional prototype that allowed users to preview decor setups virtually, choose themes, 
                    and experiment with design variations in real-time. Additional features like dark/light mode, chatbot-based 
                    decor assistance, and predefined layout templates enhanced usability.
